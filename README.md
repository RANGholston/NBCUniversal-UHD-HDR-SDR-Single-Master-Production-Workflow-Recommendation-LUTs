# NBCU-HDR-SDR-Single-Stream_Workflow_Recommendation_and_LUTS for Public Distribution

NBCU, in collaboration with Cromorama/Nick Shaw, and building on ITU working group discussions for HDR operational practices involving Dolby, BBC and Philips, has developed techniques to enable “single-stream” production that feeds both UHD HDR and SDR transmission simultaneously. 
 
The NBCU LUTs developed for this workflow enable single-stream production whereby the HDR and SDR products are consistent to the point where the benefits of HDR are realized making a unified production possible. Subsequently we’re sharing these efforts with the broadcast community for continued collaboration and use in production and distribution.   
 
The NBCU LUTS include both HLG and PQ LUTs following similar HDR/SDR conversion methodology and color science.  
  
NBCU has a commitment to industry collaboration and would like to encourage consistent media exchange, therefore we are willing to provide the NBCU LUTs freely. The NBCU LUTs are provided on an “as is” basis with no warranties. 
  
The package of NBCU LUTs with additional documentation are available at the following link:

We ask that manufactures include an acknowledgment in their license to their customers that the LUTs were “developed by NBCUniversal Media, LLC.”
