# NBCU UHD-HDR-SDR "Single-Master" Production Workflow Recommendation & LUTS for Public Distribution

<p>NBCUniversal, LLC, in collaboration with Cromorama/Nick Shaw, and building on ITU working group discussions for HDR operational practices involving Dolby, BBC and Philips, has developed techniques to enable “single-stream” production that feeds both UHD HDR and SDR transmission simultaneously.</p> 
 
<p>The NBCUniversal LUTs developed for this workflow enable single-stream production whereby the HDR and SDR products are consistent to the point where the benefits of HDR are realized making a unified production possible. Subsequently we’re sharing these efforts with the broadcast community for continued collaboration and use in production and distribution.</p>
 
<p>The NBCUniversal LUTS include both HLG and PQ LUTs following similar HDR/SDR conversion methodology and color science.</p>
  
<p>NBCUniversal has a commitment to industry collaboration and would like to encourage consistent media exchange, therefore we are willing to provide the NBCU LUTs freely. The NBCU LUTs are provided on an “as is” basis with no warranties.</p>

In collaboration with MovieLabs, we are also including their LUTs for PQ-to-HLG conversion using the links below.  [For more information from MovieLabs CLICK HERE](https://movielabs.com/distribution-specs/ultra-hd-and-hdr/).

<p>We have recently added new ICC profiles based on ICC.1:2022 (Profile version 4.4.0.0) which allow signaling of HDR and SDR in still graphics</p>

<p>Chris Seeger and Michael Drazin are happy to answer questions pertaining to this effort and provide further insight into workflow.</p>

<p>We ask that manufactures include an acknowledgment in their license to their customers that the LUTs were “developed by NBCUniversal Media, LLC.”</p>
